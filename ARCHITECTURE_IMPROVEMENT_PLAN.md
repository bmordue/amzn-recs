# Architectural Improvement Plan for amzn-recs

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the architecture, maintainability, scalability, and developer experience of the amzn-recs project. The project is a TypeScript/Node.js application that crawls Amazon product recommendations and stores them in a Neo4j graph database.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js (16-18 target, currently running on 20)
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES5 target
- **Database**: Neo4j graph database
- **Testing**: Jest framework
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose
- **CI/CD**: CircleCI and Jenkins
- **Monitoring**: StatsD metrics collection

### Current Structure
```
src/
├── api/           # Single crawl API endpoint
├── lib/           # Core business logic libraries
├── scripts/       # Utility scripts for various operations
├── test/          # Jest test suites
└── workers/       # Background processing workers
```

### Strengths
1. **Clear separation** between API, libraries, and scripts
2. **Comprehensive testing** with Jest framework
3. **Docker containerization** for deployment
4. **Graph database** appropriate for recommendation relationships
5. **Monitoring** with metrics collection
6. **Rate limiting** for external API calls

### Current Limitations

#### 1. **Technical Debt**
- Using deprecated TSLint instead of ESLint
- Node.js version mismatch (requires 16-18, running on 20)
- 7 security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Outdated TypeScript compilation target (ES5)

#### 2. **Architectural Issues**
- Monolithic structure with mixed concerns
- Single API endpoint limits extensibility
- Tightly coupled components
- Limited error handling and resilience patterns
- No clear service boundaries

#### 3. **Scalability Concerns**
- No horizontal scaling strategy
- Single point of failure in API
- Limited queue management for crawling tasks
- No load balancing considerations

#### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Inconsistent configuration management
- Limited documentation of internal APIs
- No automated code formatting
- Complex setup process

## Proposed Architectural Improvements

### 1. **Modernize Development Environment**

#### 1.1 Update Dependencies and Tooling
- **Migrate from TSLint to ESLint** with TypeScript support
- **Update Node.js target** to 18+ and TypeScript to ES2020+
- **Resolve security vulnerabilities** in dependencies
- **Add Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **Implement Husky** for git hooks and pre-commit checks

#### 1.2 Improve TypeScript Configuration
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Implement Microservices Architecture**

#### 2.1 Service Decomposition
Break the monolithic structure into focused microservices:

```
services/
├── api-gateway/       # API routing and authentication
├── crawl-service/     # Amazon crawling logic
├── recommendation-service/ # Recommendation processing
├── price-service/     # Price tracking (already exists)
├── auth-service/      # Token management and authentication
└── notification-service/ # Status updates and alerts
```

#### 2.2 API Gateway Pattern
- **Centralized routing** for all API requests
- **Authentication and authorization** management
- **Rate limiting** and request throttling
- **Request/response transformation**
- **API versioning** support

#### 2.3 Event-Driven Architecture
- **Message queues** (Redis/RabbitMQ) for service communication
- **Event sourcing** for audit trails
- **Async processing** for long-running crawl operations
- **Dead letter queues** for failed operations

### 3. **Enhance Data Architecture**

#### 3.1 Database Optimization
- **Connection pooling** for Neo4j
- **Read replicas** for query performance
- **Database migrations** management
- **Backup and recovery** procedures

#### 3.2 Caching Strategy
- **Redis caching** for frequently accessed data
- **Application-level caching** for API responses
- **Cache invalidation** strategies
- **CDN integration** for static content

#### 3.3 Data Models
```typescript
// Enhanced data models with better typing
interface Product {
  asin: string;
  title: string;
  price: Money;
  availability: ProductAvailability;
  metadata: ProductMetadata;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

interface Recommendation {
  sourceAsin: string;
  targetAsin: string;
  strength: number;
  context: RecommendationContext;
  discoveredAt: Date;
}
```

### 4. **Improve API Design**

#### 4.1 RESTful API Structure
```
/api/v1/
├── /products          # Product CRUD operations
├── /recommendations   # Recommendation queries
├── /crawl            # Crawl job management
├── /auth             # Authentication endpoints
├── /health           # Health checks
└── /metrics          # Monitoring endpoints
```

#### 4.2 GraphQL Integration
- **Unified query interface** for complex data relationships
- **Schema-first development** approach
- **Real-time subscriptions** for crawl status updates
- **Efficient data fetching** with minimal over-fetching

#### 4.3 OpenAPI Documentation
- **Automated API documentation** generation
- **Interactive API explorer**
- **Client SDK generation**
- **Contract testing** support

### 5. **Implement Resilience Patterns**

#### 5.1 Circuit Breaker Pattern
```typescript
class CrawlService {
  private circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(this.crawlAmazon.bind(this), {
    timeout: 5000,
    errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
    resetTimeout: 30000
  });
}
```

#### 5.2 Retry and Backoff
- **Exponential backoff** for failed requests
- **Jitter** to prevent thundering herd
- **Dead letter queues** for persistent failures
- **Manual retry** mechanisms for operators

#### 5.3 Health Checks and Monitoring
- **Kubernetes-ready** health check endpoints
- **Application metrics** with Prometheus
- **Distributed tracing** with OpenTelemetry
- **Structured logging** with correlation IDs

### 6. **Security Enhancements**

#### 6.1 Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect** integration
- **JWT token management** with refresh tokens
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **API key management** for service-to-service communication

#### 6.2 Security Best Practices
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Rate limiting** per user/API key
- **HTTPS enforcement** and certificate management
- **Security headers** and CORS configuration
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning**

### 7. **DevOps and Deployment**

#### 7.1 Container Orchestration
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment example
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: crawl-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: crawl-service

        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

#### 7.2 CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
